# Contributing

- Don’t commit EBA artifacts (taxonomies ZIPs, DPM ACCDB/CSV bundles, filing‑rules PDFs/XLSX).
- Use `scripts/` to fetch from official sources into `data/` (which is gitignored).
- Keep config under `config/` updated (releases, sources, module map).
- Add small synthetic samples only (non-EBA copyright).
